Analysis of Global UFO Sightings

## Introduction
This project is to clean, analyse, and present findings on UFO Sightings around the world.

## Data
The initial dataset was UFO Sightings from the 2019 Tidy Tuesday Collection. The original
dataset had information about UFO sightings from 1906 to 2014. The features included: 
Datetime, City Area, State, Country, UFO Shape, Encounter Length, Described Length, 
Description of Encounter, Date Documented, Latitude, and Longitude.<br>
Using Python/Jupyter Notebook I cleaned and carried out some data manipulation creating 
a new dataset.
