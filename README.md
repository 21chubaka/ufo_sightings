Analysis of Global UFO Sightings

## Introduction
This project is to clean, analyse, and present findings on UFO Sightings around the world.

## Data
The initial dataset was UFO Sightings from the [2019 Tidy Tuesday Collection](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-06-25/ufo_sightings.csv). The original
dataset had information about UFO sightings from 1906 to 2014. The features included: 
- Datetime
- City Area
- State
- Country
- UFO Shape
- Encounter Length
- Described Length
- Description of Encounter
- Date Documented
- Latitude
- Longitude<br>

Using Python/Jupyter Notebook I cleaned and carried out some data manipulation creating 
a new [dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/21chubaka/ufo_sightings/main/cleaned_ufo_sightings_non_us_v2.csv).
